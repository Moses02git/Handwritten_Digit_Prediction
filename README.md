# Handwritten_Digit_Prediction
# Handwritten Digit Prediction - Classification Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can classify handwritten digits (0-9) with high accuracy, precision, and recall. The model is designed to generalize well to new data, avoid overfitting, and be deployable in real-world applications such as optical character recognition (OCR) systems.

## Dataset
The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `tensorflow` or `keras`
- `scikit-learn`

Install the required packages by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
